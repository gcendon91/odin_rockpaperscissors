A little game of rock, paper & scissors where you play against the machine up to five rounds. 

This is part of The Odin Project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors">curriculum</a> and it focuses on using <b>JS</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b>

I learned more in depth how to use functions and events in addition to combining them.
